###Notes

The webpage is composed of three columns:

- Dog Breed name and exemplar
- search textfield and dropdown menu on its right hand side, four buttons:
	-  to search for a specific dog breed image,
	-  to add a breed to the selection list,
	-  also randomly a breed to the selection list,
	-  and to remove a breed from the selection list.

NB: The textfield allows for direct typing in or being filled in through clicking on a dropdown item, or, from clicking the random addition of a breed. An image is loaded only after clicking on the Search button.
